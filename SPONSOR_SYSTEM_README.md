## Services

### GoogleAdsService
The `GoogleAdsService` provides methods for:

## Frontend Integration

### Template Usage
```blade
<!-- Display all sponsors with responsive images -->
@if($partners->count() > 0)
    @foreach($partners as $partner)
        @include('front.components.responsive-sponsor', ['partner' => $partner])
    @endforeach
@endif

<!-- Include Google Ads -->
@include('front.components.google-ads')
```

### Responsive Image Component
The system includes a responsive sponsor component that automatically handles:
- Desktop and mobile image optimization
- Proper alt text for accessibility
- Lazy loading for performance
- Responsive design with CSS media queries

### CSS Classes
- `.sponsor-item` - Individual sponsor container
- `.google-ads-container` - Google Ads container
- `.sponsor-description` - Sponsor description styling

## Migration
Run the migration to add new fields:
```bash
php artisan migrate
```

## Configuration
The system automatically integrates with existing language and tenant systems. No additional configuration is required.

## Best Practices

1. **Image Optimization**: Use optimized images for better performance
2. **Alt Text**: Always provide meaningful alt text for accessibility
3. **Scheduling**: Use start/end dates for time-sensitive campaigns
4. **Placement**: Be specific with Google Ads placements for better organization
5. **Caching**: The system handles caching automatically, but you can clear cache manually if needed

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Images not displaying**: Check file permissions in `assets/front/img/partners/`
2. **Google Ads not showing**: Verify the script is valid and placement is correct
3. **Cache issues**: Clear cache using `GoogleAdsService::clearCache()`

### Debug Mode
Enable debug mode to see detailed information about ad rendering and caching.

## Security
- All file uploads are validated for allowed extensions
- Google Ads scripts are sanitized before rendering
- CSRF protection on all admin forms
- Input validation on all fields

## Performance
- Intelligent caching reduces database queries
- Lazy loading for images
- Optimized queries with proper indexing
- Minimal JavaScript for admin interface

This enhanced sponsor system provides a robust foundation for managing sponsors and Google Ads integration while maintaining excellent performance and user experience.
